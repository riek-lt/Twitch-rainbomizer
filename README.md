# Twitch-rainbowmizer
Change your twitch name colour every X amount of time!

# Installation
Make sure NPM and Nodejs are installed.  

```npm install tmi.js```  

After that, open up rainbowmizer.js with your favourite text editor, and in the top of the file, replace "your name" and "your oAuth key" with the correct information. You can find your oAuth key [here](http://twitchapps.com/tmi).  
If wanted, change the interval of name colour change. Default is 60 seconds.  
If you have Twitch Turbo or Twitch Prime, set this to `true` for the ultimate color freedom. Otherwise it will cycle through the 15 default colours.

# Run the program
```node rainbowmizer.js```
